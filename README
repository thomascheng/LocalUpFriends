Hi Kyle and Brian,

This is what I have so far. I am still in the process of "beautifying" the project. As of now, it can accept names through the use of the textbox and the "Submit" button. Then it will display the name in the list below and it will update the total number of friends, shown beneath the list. The website also supports the removal of friends by clicking on them and then clicking on the "Remove Selected Friend" button.

Let me know if there's anything that you want me to add.

P.S. Happy Halloween!
